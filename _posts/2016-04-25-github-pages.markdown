Over the course of the next week I will be decomissioning my old website and
transferring everything to GitHub Pages. 

GitHub Pages will be a more sustainable option than University servers and it
happens to run using a static site generator called "Jekyll." I have no
experience with Jekyll or anything of the like, but it is seemingly powerful
and well supported. I currently have a prototyped version of the new site that
I will continue adding content to. Later this afternoon, I will remove old site 
files from the github.io repository and push the Jekyll template. 

Portions of the website may seem underdeveloped as I transfer, but I am doing 
my best to make sure all professional information is current and representative
