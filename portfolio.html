					<td><br />&emsp; The duality project was completed for the Computer &amp; Network Security course at the University of Oregon, inspired by a PHD student's proposal. The purpose of this project is to compare and contrast networking information for both IPv4 and IPv6, in an attempt to learn more about network topologies and how they affect routing security. Our topological understanding is based on routing paths as well as autonomous system (AS) paths. The project has two major components for gathering path data. Routing paths are gathered using traceroutes through both IPv4 and IPv6, whereas AS paths are parsed out of routing tables specific to each protocol. Each component is explained in more detail below. The intended use of this suite is to further our understanding of anamalous border gateway prtocol (BGP) outages and their detectability. Note, this project is an analytic tool for conducting future BGP research and does not provide a direct means of anomaly detection.

				<tr>
					<td><b><br />Traceroute Comparison</b>
					<br /><br />&emsp; The first portion of the project involves the comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 traceroute results for each of Alexa's top 500 websites that currently support both protocols. Our goal was to compare daily traceroute results for each protocol based on hop count and variability, in an attempt explore routing paths for several autonomous systems. This functionality is provided by a Python program that runs IPv4 and IPv6 traceroutes on given domains, storing results in newly created files. An auxiliary program then processes the files and generates diagnostic information about which IP addresses were seen and how often. A batch script drives the traceroute routine through the list of top websites and optionally updates diagnostic files.

				<tr>
					<td><b><br /> IPv4 &amp; IPv6 Makes BGP Anomaly Detection Difficult </b>
					<br /><br />&emsp; Routing information base (RIB) tables store topological information about a router's "neighbors." Our approach to studying BGP behavior is to understand how this topology has changed over time, especially during known outages. Several terabytes worth of RIB tables are currently being collected and stored by the University of Oregon Route Views Archive Project designed by David Meyer. Using these RIB tables, we are able to compare AS paths for both IPv4 and IPv6 by searching for all paths that share source and destination adresses. Systems governed by BGP are still susceptible to routing attacks such as blackholes, BGP rerouting, and BGP spoofing. Moving forward, we plan to analyze BGP behavior during past events where routing attacks were believed to be the cause of specific outages. <br /><br /><br />
